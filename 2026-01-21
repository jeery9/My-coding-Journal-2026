So I leant some html for this week, and part of next week ihope all will be well

So technically this is what i learnt,

then linking the css file to my html
i also learnt to make links and to add images...

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8">
		<meta size="device-width">
		<link type="stylesheet"       -not sure about this i gotta check this again😂😂 am still learning bruh!
	</head>
	<body>
					<a href="https link here"> </a>  <!--TODO:This is for the image link-->

					<img src="image lnk here" alt="The image caption right here">

					<a target="_blank" href="https link here!">  <!--TODO:This opens the link in a new tab-->
