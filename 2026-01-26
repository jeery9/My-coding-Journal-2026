Today has been very sick bro, but i have learnt alot of staff what has caught my attention so far is:
 How to add an image to an "a" element..
 This to mean...

 
      <figure>
       <a href="1212212">
       <image src=" 12345" alt=" jaksjasa" > 
       </a>
       <figcaption>This is a tree...</figcaption>
      </figure>

      
  This is amazing i can even  add caption, i still can be able to recall all that, am smart boy😂😂

  Before i forget i have also learnt about "id" and "class"
  One is represented with a (.) and another a (#) am not really sure whether i understood but I shall revisit

  we  also have   &gt;p&lt   this simply means <p>
  Then we also have the one for copyright and trademark when i remember i shall update otherwise its time to left
